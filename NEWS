PEL Version 0.2  16th May 2004
******************************

Notes: This release brings updated documentation and better support
for the EXIF user comment tag and tags containing version information.
The code is now tested using SimpleTest.

Changes:

* All PelExifEntry descendant classes now use setValue() and
  getValue() methods consistently.

* Signed and unsigned numbers (bytes, shorts, longs, and rationals)
  are now handled correctly.

* The SimpleTest (http://sf.net/projects/simpletest) framework is used
  for regression testing.

* Added new PelExifEntryUserComment class to better support the EXIF
  user comment tag.

* Added new PelExifEntryVersion class to support the EXIF tags with
  version information, namely the EXIF_VERSION, FLASH_PIX_VERSION, and
  INTEROPERABILITY_VERSION tags.

* Updated doc comments all over.

PEL Version 0.1  8th May 2004
*****************************

Notes: The initial release of PEL.  Most of the functionality is in
place: JPEG files are parsed, EXIF entries are found and interpreted,
the entries can be edited and new entries can be added, and finally,
the whole thing can be turned into bytes and saved as a valid JPEG
file.

The API is still subject to change, and will remain so until version
1.0 is reached.
