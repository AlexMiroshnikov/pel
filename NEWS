PEL Version 0.4  (not yet released)
***********************************

Notes:

Changes:

* Updated documentation.


PEL Version 0.3  May 25th, 2004
*******************************

Notes:

Support was added for parsing TIFF images, leading to a mass renaming
of files and classes to cleanup the class hierarchy.  The decoding of
EXIF data is now tested against known values (over 400 individual
tests), this lead to the discovery of a couple of subtle bugs.  The
documentation has been updated and expanded.

Changes:

* Renamed all files and classes so that only EXIF specific code is
  labeled with Exif.  So, for example, PelExifIfd is now PelIfd, since
  the IFD structure isn't specific to EXIF but rather to TIFF images.
  The same applies to the former PelExifEntry* classes.

* Fixed offset bug in PelDataWindow::getBytes() which caused the
  method to return too much data.

* Added support for the SCENE_TYPE tag.

* Fixed display of integer version numbers.  Version x.0 would be
  displayed as just version 'x' before.

* Unit tests for EXIF decoding.  PEL is now tested with an image from
  a Sony DSC V1 and one from a Canon IXUS II.

* Changed all occurrences of include_once() to require_once() since
  the files are required.

* Updated documentation all over.


PEL Version 0.2  May 16th, 2004
*******************************

Notes:

This release brings updated documentation and better support for the
EXIF user comment tag and tags containing version information.  The
code is now tested using SimpleTest.

Changes:

* All PelExifEntry descendant classes now use setValue() and
  getValue() methods consistently.

* Signed and unsigned numbers (bytes, shorts, longs, and rationals)
  are now handled correctly.

* The SimpleTest (http://sf.net/projects/simpletest) framework is used
  for regression testing.

* Added new PelExifEntryUserComment class to better support the EXIF
  user comment tag.

* Added new PelExifEntryVersion class to support the EXIF tags with
  version information, namely the EXIF_VERSION, FLASH_PIX_VERSION, and
  INTEROPERABILITY_VERSION tags.

* Updated doc comments all over.

PEL Version 0.1  May 8th, 2004
******************************

Notes:

The initial release of PEL.  Most of the functionality is in place:
JPEG files are parsed, EXIF entries are found and interpreted, the
entries can be edited and new entries can be added, and finally, the
whole thing can be turned into bytes and saved as a valid JPEG file.

The API is still subject to change, and will remain so until version
1.0 is reached.
