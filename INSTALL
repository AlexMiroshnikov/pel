INSTALL file for PEL: PHP EXIF Library.  A library with support for
reading and writing all EXIF headers of JPEG images using PHP.

Copyright (C) 2004  Martin Geisler <gimpster@users.sourceforge.net>
Licensed under the GNU GPL, see COPYING for details.


Requirements
************

PEL requires PHP 5.  The world is still waiting for the final release
of this version, but in the mean time the release candidates should be
used.  PEL was developed with PHP 5 Release Candidate 2.


Installation
************

PEL is installed by downloading it and unpacking it in a directory of
your choice.  Your application can then start using the classed
defined in PEL, most likely the PelJpegData class which contain an
entire JPEG image.


Usage
*****

Your application should include at least the PelDataWindow.php file
for the definition of the basic PelDataWindow class which is used to
stored data in.  The PelJpegData class is also needed if PEL should do
the parsing of JPEG data for you.

This example will load a JPEG file given as a command line argument,
parse the EXIF data within, change the comment to 'Edited by PEL', and
finally save the file again.

  <?php
  include_once('PelJpegData.php');
  include_once('PelDataWindow.php');
  
  $data = new PelDataWindow(file_get_contents($argv[1]));
  $jpeg = new PelJpegData($data);
  
  $ifd0 = $jpeg->getSection(2)->getContent()->getIfd();
  $entry = $ifd0->getEntry(PelExifTag::IMAGE_DESCRIPTION);
  $entry->setAscii('Edited by PEL');
  file_put_contents($argv[1], $jpeg->getBytes());
  ?>

See the test directory for this example and others as PHP files.  You
may have to adjust the path found in the very first line of the files
before you can execute them.
