README file for PEL: PHP EXIF Library.  A library with support for
reading and writing EXIF headers in JPEG and TIFF images using PHP.

Description
***********

The PHP EXIF Library (PEL) makes it easy to develop programs that will
read and write the EXIF metadata headers found in JPEG and TIFF
images.  See the file INSTALL for an introduction to how PEL can be
used by your application.

PEL is a library written entirely in PHP, which means that it does not
have any dependencies outside the core of PHP, it does not even use
the EXIF module available for PHP.

Please note that the API for PEL is not yet frozen, and it will remain
changeable until version 1.0 is reached.  Go to the PEL development
mailing list (look below) and share your ideas about how the API
should look like.


Features
********

* Reads and and writes EXIF metadata from both JPEG and TIFF images.

* Supports reading and writing all EXIF tags.

* Supports internationalisation.

* Extensible object-oriented design.

* Unit-tested with SimpleTest (http://sf.net/projects/simpletest).

* Documented with PhpDocumentor (http://phpdoc.org/).


Getting Support
***************

The first place you should consult for support is the documentation
supplied with PEL, found in the 'doc' directory.  There you will find
a complete API documentation which describes all the classes and files
in PEL, and their use.

The scripts found in the 'examples' directory are also a good source
of information.

PEL is hosted on SourceForge and uses the tools found there for
support.  For general discussions about the future development of PEL,
please use the development mailing list.  Remember to subscribe before
you post on the list, you can subscribe here:

If you have a specific support request, a bug report, a feature
request, or maybe a patch, please use the corresponding tracker:

Contributing Test Images
************************

To make PEL as stable as possible, it is tested with images from a
number of different camera models.  Those test images have been split
out into a separate download, to make the core PEL as small and quick
as possible to download.  Download the test images from the PEL
homepage:

  http://pel.sourceforge.net/

New test images are very much appreciated --- please download the
existing test images and read the README file found there for
instructions.
