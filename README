Copyright (C) 2004  Martin Geisler <gimpster@users.sourceforge.net>
Licensed under the GNU GPL, see COPYING for details.


Description
***********

PEL lets you read and write EXIF headers found in JPEG images easily.
See the file INSTALL for an introduction to how PEL can be used by
other applications.

Please note that PEL is not mature, the API will probably change
before version 1.0 is reached.  Go to the PEL development mailinglist
(look below) and share your ideas about how the API should look like.


Features
********

* Reads and parses JPEG and TIFF images.

* Supports reading and writing all tags supported by the C libexif
  (http://sf.net/projects/libexif) library.

* Extensible object-oriented design.

* Unit-tested with SimpleTest (http://sf.net/projects/simpletest).


Getting Support
***************

The first place you should consult for support is the documentation
supplied with PEL, found in the 'doc' directory.  There you'll find a
complete API documentation which describes all the classes and files
in PEL, and their use.

The API documentation will not be present if you have retrieved PEL
from CVS --- in that case, you can either generate it yourself using
phpDocumentor (http://phpdoc.org/) or read it online at

  http://pel.sourceforge.net/doc/

PEL is hosted on SourceForge and uses the tools found there for
support.  For general discussions about the future development of PEL,
please use the development mailinglist.  Remember to subscribe before
you post on the list, you can subscribe here:

If you have a specific support request, a bug report, a feature
request, or maybe a patch, please use the corresponding tracker:
