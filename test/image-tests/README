PEL Test Images
***************

The images contained in this directory are test images collected for
use with PEL: PHP EXIF Library.  One can download PEL from:

  http://pel.sourceforge.net/

All images except no-exif.jpg contain EXIF information, and the
corresponding PHP files contain SimpleTest (http://simpletest.sf.net/)
unit tests.

To use those files with PEL, simply place this directory (the
image-tests directory) under the test directory in an unpacked PEL
source tree.

The images can be used by anybody, but may only be redistributed under
the GNU GPL.  See the file COPYING for the details.
