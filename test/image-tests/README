PEL Test Images
***************

The images contained in this directory are test images collected for
use with PEL: PHP EXIF Library.  One can download PEL from:

  http://pel.sourceforge.net/

All images except no-exif.jpg contain EXIF information, and the
corresponding PHP files contain SimpleTest (http://simpletest.sf.net/)
unit tests.

To use those files with PEL, simply place this directory (the
image-tests directory) under the test directory in an unpacked PEL
source tree.

The images can be used by anybody, but may only be redistributed under
the GNU GPL.  See the file COPYING for the details.


Contributing Test Images
************************

If you own a camera model from which there are no test image, then
please contribute one.  The image should

* contain as much interesting EXIF tags as possible.  The camera
  should therefore be set to a manual mode, and the settings should be
  changed from their defaults,

* have as small a file size as possible, so use a resolution of
  640x480 or less, if possible.  Also, use the poorest image quality
  (the best compression) to reduce the file size.  It should be
  possible to get the file size down to around 50--75 KiB.

* should come from the camera unaltered.  Do not resize the image
  using an image manipulation program, for then it is this program
  that will be tested, not the camera that took the image,

* be of something neutral --- a flower, a mountain or something like
  that, and not be a shot from a private party,

* licensed under the GNU GPL as the rest of PEL, so that it can be
  redistributed as part of the test suite.

Submit your test image(s) using the SourceForge Patch Tracker found at

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=108380&atid=650324

All image contributers will be given full credit in the AUTHORS file
distributed with PEL and on the PEL homepage at http://pel.sf.net/.
