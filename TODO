TODO List for PEL
*****************

In addition to the following list, then the source contains a number
of comments beginning with 'TODO' which marks extra places where
attention is needed.

* Add convenience functions.
   It would be nice to have functions that could give you a particular
   entry with just one function call.

* Interpret the MakerNotes

* Look at using Gettext or some other tool for I18n.

* Document all files, classes, and methods.

* Write test cases for SimpleTest
   Get it from http://sf.net/projects/simpletest.

* Write functions to replace the builtin PHP EXIF functions.
   This would make PEL a drop-in replacement for people who cannot use
   the PHP EXIF extension.
