TODO List for PEL
*****************

In addition to the following list, then the source contains a number
of comments beginning with 'TODO' which marks extra places where
attention is needed.

* Make it possible to construct new EXIF data.
   The class constructors have to be changed to accept only the most
   necessary arguments, and not a PelDataWindow object as today.  The
   classes then need new addXXX methods that one would call to add
   sections, entries, or whatever.

* Add convenience functions.
   It would be nice to have functions that could give you a particular
   entry or the embedded thumbnail with just one function call.

* Interpret the MakerNotes.

* Test and interpret GPS information.

* Handle character encodings of the USER_COMMENT tag.
