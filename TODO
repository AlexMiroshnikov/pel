TODO List for PEL
*****************

In addition to the following list, then the source contains a number
of comments beginning with 'TODO' which marks extra places where
attention is needed.
   
* Handle broken images better.
   PEL now ignores entries which cannot be loaded --- this behavious
   should probably be configurable.

* Add convenience functions.
   It would be nice to have functions that could give you a particular
   entry or the embedded thumbnail with just one function call.
   Manually traversing the directory structure (and repeatedly
   checking for null pointers) requires too big a knowledge of the
   structure of JPEG, TIFF, and EXIF formats.

* Interpret the MakerNotes.
   The libexif project already has code for interpretating the
   MakerNotes for a number of different camera models.

* Test and interpret tags with GPS information.
   This basically waits until I get a picture with GPS information.

* Handle character encodings of the USER_COMMENT tag.
   The first eight bytes store the character encoding, but PEL ignores
   them for now.  Using the Multibyte String PHP extension we should
   be able to convert the data.

* Deal with characters outside Latin-1 in PelEntryWindowsString.
   This needs testing from people running Windows XP set to a locale
   different from Latin-1.

* Investigate the JPEG comment section.
