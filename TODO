TODO List for PEL
*****************

In addition to the following list, then the source contains a number
of comments beginning with 'TODO' which marks extra places where
attention is needed.

* Add convenience functions.
   It would be nice to have functions that could give you a particular
   entry or the embedded thumbnail with just one function call.

* Interpret the MakerNotes.

* Test and interpret GPS information.

* Document all files, classes, and methods.

* Write functions to replace the built-in PHP EXIF functions.
   This would make PEL a drop-in replacement for people who cannot use
   the PHP EXIF extension.

* Handle character encodings of the USER_COMMENT tag.
