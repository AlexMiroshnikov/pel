TODO List for PEL
*****************

In addition to the following list, then the source contains a number
of comments beginning with `TODO' and `FIXME' which marks extra places
where attention is needed.

* Restructure information about tags.
   Currently information about the tags are stored in several places
   around the code, making updates difficult.  All information about a
   tag should be stored at one place, maybe by having a class per tag
   (how well does PHP handle 142 small classes?).

   The information in question is:

   - hex code,
   - title,
   - name,
   - description
   - format,
   - components,
   - valid IFD types,
   - how to load data,
   - how to display (the getText() method)
   
* Add convenience functions.
   It would be nice to have functions that could give you a particular
   entry or the embedded thumbnail with just one function call.
   Manually traversing the directory structure (and repeatedly
   checking for null pointers) requires too big a knowledge of the
   structure of JPEG, TIFF, and EXIF formats.

* Interpret the MakerNotes.
   The libexif project already has code for interpretating the
   MakerNotes for a number of different camera models.

* Handle character encodings of the USER_COMMENT tag.
   The first eight bytes store the character encoding, but PEL ignores
   them for now.  Using the Multibyte String PHP extension we should
   be able to convert the data.

* Deal with characters outside Latin-1 in PelEntryWindowsString.
   This needs testing from people running Windows XP set to a locale
   different from Latin-1.

* Investigate the JPEG comment section.
